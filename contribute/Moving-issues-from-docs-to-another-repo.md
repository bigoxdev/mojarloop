It's helpful if an issue is in the repo the code is in. This allows the team to filter on the issues for that code. Since many issues are currently in Docs, teams will want to move them.

There is a move issue button at the bottom of the page for the issue, however, many attributes don't move with the issue

* Epics can't be moved unless you first make them not epics (use the "delete the epic" button).
* Labels don't move, and have to be re-added. The **Story** label needs to be added in the new repo.
* Assigned to and story points don't move and have to be manually added.
* Milestones aren't moved and need to be recreated and associated with the story. The milestone must have the same name in both repos and the start and end dates must match.

Be aware that stories are closed in the old repo and opened in the new one, which can mess with the total points.
