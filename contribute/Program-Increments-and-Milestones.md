# Program Increments, Sprints, and Milestones

**Program Increments (PIs)** are a length of time typically equal to 4 sprints or 8 weeks. Occasionally, the last sprint in the PI might be a week longer or shorter to work around holidays. 

**Sprints** are two week intervals (except in special cases for holidays). 

GitHub **Milestones** are used to track both Sprints and PIs.  We use a simple naming convention for milestones of PI.Sprint. Here's an example:
> **PI-2.1** - First Sprint in Program Increment #2  (8/8 - 8/19)

> **PI-2.2** - Second Sprint in Program Increment #2 (8/22 - 9/2)

> **PI-2.3** - Third Sprint in Program Increment #2 (9/5 - 9/16)

> **PI-2.4** - Fourth and Final Sprint in Program Increment #2 (9/19 - 9/30)

All sprints and program increments have measurable objectives that should be demonstrable upon completion. These may be a combination of the acceptance criteria for the epics and stories in them, but are more often a summary of the work.
