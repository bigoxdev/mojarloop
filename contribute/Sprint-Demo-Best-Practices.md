At the end of each iteration (2-week sprint) each team will demo working code.

* 6-8 minute live demo with 5 minute Q&A
* focus on acceptance criteria, the right level of details and showing you are 'done'
* demo working code
* tell a story; demos should be focused around a user story
* keep it short and relevant to what the other teams need to know
* feel free to provide constructive feedback to teams, with follow-up post-meeting

Other Notes:

* The Release Train Engineer (RTE) will record the session for review by those that could not attend
* Even though this event is termed a "demo", you must real working code from a real build and no "smoke and mirrors" or prototype code unless that was the main goal of the story
