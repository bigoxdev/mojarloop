There are no estimates on Epics or Scenarios.  Stories are associated with Epics and have their own story points and roll up. Team often T-shirt size epics before going into PI planning.  

All Stories need to be completed within a Sprint and all Epics within a Program Increment.

Teams estimate their own work using a group technique such as planning poker or wide band delphi. 

Story points are unique to the team and can't be compared across teams. Teams will track their velocity in story points per sprint.
