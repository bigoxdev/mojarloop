**How do I control all my email notifications?**
GitHub sends you mail for every repo you are in based on your subscription, see https://github.com/LevelOneProject/repo goes here/subscription. It defaults to "tell you everything", but "only tell me if I'm mentioned" is easier to deal with. 

Slack can also notify for each channel you are in. See channel settings (the gear in the top right)/notification preferences. Slack has a channel for GitHub messages, so between the setting on this channel and the setting in GitHub you can control whether to get GitHub messages in your email or in Slack and how often. Slack can also send messages directly to email (see your account settings), which when you combine this with GitHub can get silly.
